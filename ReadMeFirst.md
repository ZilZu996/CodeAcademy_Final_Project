Hello,

in order to launch this App you need to install npm in both Server and Frontend folders.

After that you need to enter Server folder and type NPM RUN DEV.

This command will start both servers. For frontend and for server. For that I used concurrently.

This app only uses local servers so in the begining there will be no data but it can be added by pressing New user.

In order to login you need to use this data:
email: "zilvinas.zube@admin.com",
password: "codeacademy",

Data can be deleted, edited and viewed.

Thanks for your time!
